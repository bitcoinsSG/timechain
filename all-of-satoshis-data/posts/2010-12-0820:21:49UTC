Re: JSON-RPC method idea: list transactions newer than a given txid

   Itʼs not safe to use listtransactions this way.
   I know Iʼve been criticized for being reluctant about listtransactions.
    Let me explain my reluctance.
   Transactions are dynamic.  Past transactions can become unconfirmed, go
   away and come back, become invalid and disappear, or be replaced by a
   different double-spend.  Their date can change, their order can change.
   Programmers are naturally inclined to want to use listtransactions like
   this: feed me the new transactions since I last asked, and Iʼll keep my
   own tally or static record of them.  This will seem to work in all
   regular use, but if you use the amounts for anything, it is highly
   exploitable:
   1) How do you know if a past transaction becomes invalid and
   disappears?
   2) When thereʼs a block-chain reorg, it would be easy to double-count
   transactions when they get confirmed again.
   3) A transaction can be replaced by a double-spend with a different
   txid.  You would count both spends.
   The model where you assume you only need to see new transactions
   because youʼve already seen previous transactions is not true.  Old
   transactions can change at any time.
   Any time you take an action based on payment amounts received, you
   always need to go back to bitcoin and ask for a current balance total
   (or use move or sendfrom), and be ready for the possibility that it can
   go down.
   Now that we have the Accounts feature making it easier to do it the
   right way, weʼre better prepared to have listtransactions.
